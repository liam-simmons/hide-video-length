# Hide Video Length

Hide Video Length is a browser extension that helps you avoid spoilers by hiding the length of videos on YouTube. This can be useful if you don't want to know how long a video is before watching it, as video length can sometimes give away important plot points.

## Installation

To get started, rename the ".env.example" file to ".env". Then, depending on your browser requirements, run one of the following commands:

- `yarn && yarn build:chrome` or `yarn && yarn build:firefox`
- `npm install && npm run build:chrome` or `npm install && npm run build:firefox`

This will install the required dependencies and build the extension for your browser into the build directory.
